      <h3 id="main-subtitle">my relationship with HTML, CSS and the DOM</h3>
      <p>
        hi I'm javascript! the baddest MF in the programming world - the
        G.O.A.T! I have extremely close relations with HTML, CSS and the DOM
        because they are my portal to your world and vice versa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the DOM, we three can interact with you - yes YOU beautiful
        human, everytime you click, hover or submit a form on a website - and
        much more! You could say (but not too loudly) that I'm dependent on
        these guys but don't let them know that or I'll never hear the end of
        it.
      </p>
      <br />

      <img id="dom" src="../the-dom.jpg" /><br />

      <p>
        Speaking of the DOM, well he's pretty badass too. Some will say he holds
        the key to said portal, but actually - he IS the portal. Though he lives
        amongst a forest of object trees full of nodes and is a stickler for
        methods and properties, he's easily manipulated and that works to our
        advantage. It makes updating and controlling HTML things on-the-fly much
        easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Get on his good side and you can call him by his first name
        'document.' or his alias 'element.'- don't forget that dot! You'll need
        it to access stuff from my objects - but I'll talk about that in a
        minute.

      <h3 id="main-subtitle">control flow and two of my bff's</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not proud of it but I'm a control freak with a tad bit of OCD. I
        perform all my tasks in a certain and very specific order. My childhood
        friends all know this about me, they even help to keep things under
        control so I don't lose my shit if things go wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        My bestie Loops can attest to this. For example I taught her my tea-
        making process and she practiced it over and over repeatedly, you know -
        in a loop, only she kept forgetting some steps so I had to include
        conditional statements so she'd remember.
      </p>
      <p>for each cup of tea do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>get the kettle on</li>
        <li>get a clean mug and put tea-bag of choice inside</li>
        <li>
          DO NOT put milk in before water or you'll have wasted perfectly good
          tea
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>if user adds milk before water, return 'fail', else do this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>when kettle has boiled, add hot water to mug</li>
        <li>let tea-bag steep for 3min</li>
        <li>add milk of your choice</li>
      </ul>

      <p>return 'sip, relax and enjoy'.</p>
      <p>
        My BFF Functions then came along and automated this entire tea-making
        loop. He called it 'makeTea', bundled it into a package and slapped a fat
        arrow on top. Now everytime I want to make tea I just call 'makeTea(engBreakfast)'
        and voila! a perfect cuppa every time. What can I say? My friends are
        pretty awesome.

      <h3 id="main-subtitle">i keep things nice and tidy</h3>
      <p>
        Ok ok now you know I'm a control freak with specific repeptitive actions
        that are bundled into functions, so of course it's no surprise I store
        my belongings in a very orderly manner using arrays and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every [item] in one of my drawers (I call them arrays) is accounted for
        with an index.<br />

        <br /><img src="../array-example.jpg" />
      </p>

      <p>
        It always starts at zero so you if you need a scarf for the day just
        write drawer[1] and hey presto, I present - your scarves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also keep an inventory of exactly what type of items are in my
        drawers! I usually keep this inventory as an object - a collection of
        properties that are key value pairs.<br />

        <br /><img src="../object-example.jpg" />
      </p>
      <p>
        there's that dot again! Use it to access or change properties of an
        object.
      </p>
      <p>
        well I hope you've enjoyed getting to know a bit about me. I
        may be difficult to love as I'm very complex, pedantic and sometimes
        uncooperative but once you know me I promise it's all worth it.
        Ciaoooooo!
