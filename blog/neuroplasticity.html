			<h3 id="main-subtitle">neuroplasticity & how it benefits us</h3>
			<p>
				Neuroplasticity refers to the "brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of
				experience", so during my current learning journey I want to adopt the following principles
				of neuroplasticity:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Use it and Improve it: Driving a specific brain function leads to improving abilities
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					Use it or Lose it: Failure to drive specific brain functions can lead to loss of abilities
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>Repetition Matters: Change needs sufficient repetition</li>
				<br />
				<li>Salience Matters: the training must be meaningful in order to cause change</li>
			</ul>

				<a id="interview" href="https://youtu.be/zX4DeCV31YY"
					>this interview with Dr Caroline Leaf</a

				is one that has completely changed my approach to learning and to life in general. It's one
				that I will refer to often as I truly believe you ARE mind, so be kind to it, nurture it and
				you can conquer any toxic and negative thoughts and achieve anything you set your mind to.

				is the idea that your intellect and your abilities are not fixed traits but can be improved
				depending on how you approach and view challenges and setbacks. People with a growth mindset
				believe it's good to struggle because with some work, your skills will change and get better
				over time.

				showed me there are two ways of looking at a problem that is hard to solve - are you not
				smart enough to solve it, or have you just not solved it yet? 'The power of yet' is
				something I am going to adopt into my learning plan. It's really encouraged me to embrace
				challenges and struggling to solve a problem as opportunities to grow.
