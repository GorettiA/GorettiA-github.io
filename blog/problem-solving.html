			<p>
			Hi my non-tech savvy friend! Just finished melting my brain with some javascript functions. I will try to
			explain this in the simplest terms. If I lose you at any point, just nod and read on.
			</p>
			<p>
			I was tasked to write a JS function which takes a list of numbers and prints out a specific word for multiples of
			3, 5 and 15. So the goal was this:
			</p><br>

			<p>
				I brewed a coffee and got to work using a couple of different problem-solving techniques - I'll touch on those in the next section below.
				But here is the code I came up with:
			</p><br>
			<img class="screenshot" src="../buzz.jpg"><br>
			<p>
				Of course it didn't work. Never ever works the first time. It was saying the function is to return the word 'Fizz'
				for multiples of both 3 AND 5. <br>
				So now I went for a deep dive into a Google rabbit hole searching for meaning and ternary operators that
				tell the computer to do something specific if two conditions are both TRUE.<br>
				Didn't work. Same error.
			</p>

			<p>
				I was getting nowhere. I ended up having to consult the answers provided because I just could not work this one out. 
				Guess what? Of course it came down to control flow! As in the order in which javascript executes/performs tasks.
			</p>

			<p>
				The computer reads it from top-to-bottom so it meant I had to change what condition runs first. Hooray! Happy days! Fizzbuzzzzzz

			<p>
				first thing I did was get pseudocoding! Breaking down the problem into smaller bite sized chunks, using the information
				I already had. It makes the problem seem more manageable and less daunting.
			</p>
			<p>
				(rubber ducky method is a given in ALL of my learning because I'm constantly thinking out loud when I'm working so 
				this is not included in my problem-solving methods because it's a constant)
			</p>
			<p>
				second thing in this scenario was 'trying something'. I knew from my pseudocode that I would need to be working
				with conditional if/else statements. Started here using what I already knew.
			</p>
			<p>
				it wouldn't be coding if we didn't consult Google. When stuck - get to Googling.
