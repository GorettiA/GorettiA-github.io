        <h3 id="main-subtitle">what are they?</h3>
        <p>they are two types of CSS selectors which are used to point to certain specific HTML elements so you can apply some styling to them</p>

        <h3 id="main-subtitle">how and when to use class</h3>
        <p>give a single or group of HTML elements the same class name and the CSS styling will be targeted and applied to them 
            as I've done so below where my 'section div' has a class name of 'blog-topic':  

            <p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="../class-selector.jpg">
            </p>
        
        Time to add some CSS magic. Head over to your css file and use the '.' before the class name to point to them - like so:

        <p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../class-css-selector.jpg" alt="class-css-selector">
        </p>
            <p>
                Your awesome CSS styling will now be applied to any and all HTML elements with 'blog-topic' class name. Easy peasy.

    <section class="blog-topic">
        <h3 id="main-subtitle">how and when to use id</h3>
        <p>id selector is used to select and target a single HTML element with a unique id attribute. 
            It's unique so it can only be applied to this specific HTML element. 
        </p>  

        <p>
            Like your IRD tax number - 
            it belongs and is unique to you. Noone else can use it to identify themselves and so this HTML element gets its own unique 
            identifier in the form of a an id selector.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I've got here an example of a header element with an id of 'main-subtitle': 
        </p>
            <p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="../id-css-selector.jpg">
            </p>
               
            <p>what's next? You guessed it. Go over to your css file now and use '#' before the id name, so we can make more awesome:</p>
        <p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../id-css-file.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>Hey presto! the medium orchird font colour is and will be applied to my h3 element with this 'main-subtitle' id</p>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-topic">
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">so when to use id and when to use class ?</h3>
            <p>
                best practice is to use id for single elements that appear on the page only once like a header or footer. Each
                element can have only one ID and each page can have only one element with that ID.
            </p>
            <p>
                use class for single or multiple elements that appear once or more like paragraphs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                keep in mind as well that in css world, id selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors becuse it's well,
                more specific :)
