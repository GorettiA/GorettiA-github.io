          <h3 id="main-subtitle">the bootcamp edition</h3>
          <p>
              Revisiting my original learning plan set down in the first week, not much has changed to be honest.
              I still want to finish Dev Academy with the knowledge and understanding I need of JS (and back-end technology)
              to be able to apply it to different scenarios and become a really good problem solver. Destination?
              Working remotely building awesome React JS apps.
          </p>
          <p>
              I see my strengths as constant but what I have found now at the end of foundations is that yes I may be a 'slow learner'
              but thanks to the power of yet, growth mindset & neuroplasticity wow I think I I'm equipped with all I need 
              to excel in this chapter and I'm super excited about that!
          </p>
          <h3 id="main-subtitle">human skills to touch up on</h3>
          <p>
              Biggest non-technical challenge will hands down be keeping up with the intensity of the course and making sure I'm well 
              rested. Sleep patterns are so out of whack at the moment but I hope once I start up at bootcamp and incorporate
              the self-care priority of gym and healthier eating, that my current sleeping patterns will improve.
          </p>
          <p>
              Human skills I'd like to see developed while I'm at Dev Academy is the ability to be more open to sharing my ideas.
              This would mean being more open to critiques from my cohort and becoming less sensitive to criticism. I don't know
              how I would go about doing this. I hope Dev can show me the way.
          </p>
          <p>
              Support from the bootcamp team means encouraging staff and a supportive learning environment. I will be asking A LOT of questions when I am lost/confused. I am not afraid to ask questions but I do
              hope the facilitators will be able to ELI5 (explain like I'm 5) - pictures, diagrams and simple terms please.
          </p>
          <h3 id="main-subtitle">my commitment to manage my workload</h3>
          <p>
              I commit to keeping to a strict routine in and around bootcamp which includes, as always, a priority of
              self-care. Going to the gym, working out and eating healtheir will help to improve not just
              my healthy but also my learning as well as sleep patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
              If I sleep better, feel better I will just be an even nicer person for my classmates to be around. Win win.

        <section class="blog-topic">
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">foundations edition</h3>
            <p>Short term goal - be employable as a junior full-stack developer and accepted for a paid internship. to be confident enough in javascript
                and go on to create fully functional React JS apps.
            </p>
            <p>Long long term goal - to be a fundamental part of a start-up tech company whose common goal is going to impact
                the world in a positive and unexpected way.</p>
        
       
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">strengths & limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <p>Strength: Attitude. Super keen to learn as much as I can and make the most out of my journey with Dev Academy.</p>
            <p>Limitation: 'Slow Learner'. Stop, wait can you explain that again please? Nope still don't get it, please draw a picture.</p>
            <p>Strength: Committed. To my learning and this current path I'm on because I have no other option. I'm here to establish
                a career in the tech industry and I'm committed to doing whatever it takes to make that happen.
            </p>
            <p>Limitation: 'Easily distracted'. Ooooh another YouTube video from my favourite tech reviewers.....I'm hungry.</p>
            

        
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">skills to be developed</h3>
            <p>Technical: Full-stack dev with a focus on javascript so that I'm confident I can walk into
                an interview knowing I'm equipped and capable of tackling the tests and questions - then hopefully land the job :)
            </p>
            <p>Human: to be less sensitive to criticism. A part of the reason I don't always open up to sharing my ideas
                is because I fear being criticised for them. I blame my INFJ personality type.
            </p>
            <p>Human: Learn to articulate my thoughts and ideas verbally. Other introverts have this same issue because we overthink and rehearse
                how to word things in our mind so much that when it comes to actually speaking, it can be mistaken
                for us being 'stupid' or 'slow'. I promise I'm not stupid - just slow LOL.
            </p>
       
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">how will I manage my workload & working productively with others</h3>
            <p>By having open-minded exchanges with others, demonstrating a keenness to learn from everyone I meet.
            </p>
            <p>When things start building up its important for me to prioritise self-care (fitness & wellbeing)
                and stay in touch with my best friends who crack me up and keep me centred.
            </p>
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">how and where I'll seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>Consult google, classmates and then my facilitator. Most importantly do this before I get lost in the rabbit hole.
                If I've spent more than 15min trying to research a problem without any progress, it's time to put my hand up and scream "HELP ME!!! please".
            </p>
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">what I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p>Oh just 24hr 7 days a week availability please lol. Seriously though most important for me is having patience 
                to answer my questions. 

            <p>
                "Slide-city please!" - said noone ever. Powerpoint slides just won't cut it for me, nope nope nope. Multi-modal learner here.
            </p>
                Adaptability - please be prepared to adjust your explanations if I am still not getting it.
            </p>
            <p>FAAFETAI LAVA, THANK YOU</p>
