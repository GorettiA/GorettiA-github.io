            <h3 id="main-subtitle">long term goal & career pathway</h3>
            <p>Short term goal - be employable as a junior full-stack developer and accepted for a paid internship. to be confident enough in javascript
                that I could go on to create fully functioning React JS apps (with google and rubber ducky of course).
            </p>
            <p>Long long term goal - to be a fundamental part of a start-up tech company whose common goal is going to impact
                the world in a positive way.</p>

            <h3 id="main-subtitle">strengths & limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <p>Strength: Attitude. Super keen to learn as much as I can and make the most out of my journey with Dev Academy.</p>
            <p>Limitation: 'Slow Learner'. Stop, wait can you explain that again please? Nope still don't get it, please draw a picture.</p>
            <p>Strength: Committed. To my learning and this current path I'm on because I have no other option. I'm here to establish
                a career in the tech industry and I'm committed to doing whatever it takes to make that happen.
            </p>
            <p>Limitation: 'Easily distracted'. Ooooh another YouTube video from my favourite tech reviewers.....I'm hungry.</p>

        <section class="blog-topic">
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">skills to be developed</h3>
            <p>Technical: Full-stack dev with a focus on javascript so that I'm confident I can walk into
                an interview knowing I'm equipped and capable of tackling the tests and questions - and land the job!
            </p>
            <p>Human: to be less sensitive to criticism. A part of the reason I don't always open up to sharing my ideas
                is because I fear being criticised for them. I blame my INFJ personality type.
            </p>
            <p>Human: Learn to articulate my thoughts and ideas verbally. Absolutely LOVE writing but I want to 
                be able to verbalise my ideas better. Other introverts have this same issue because we overthink and rehearse
                how to word things in our mind so much that when it comes to actually speaking, it can be mistaken
                for us being 'stupid' or 'slow'. I promise I'm not stupid - just slow LOL.

        <section class="blog-topic">
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">how will I manage my workload</h3>
            <p>By having open-minded exchanges with others, demonstrating a keenness to learn from everyone I meet.
                Remember that everyone is on their own journey and we can all benefit from each other in some way.
            </p>
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">how and where I'll seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>Consult google, classmates and then my facilitator. Most importantly do this before I get way too deep into the rabbit hole.
                If I've spent more than 15min trying to research a problem without any progress, it's time to put my hand up and scream "HELP ME!!! please".
            </p>
            <h3 id="main-subtitle">what I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p>Oh just 24hr 7 days a week availability please lol. Seriously though most important for me is having patience 
                to answer my questions. 

            <p>
                "Slide-city please!" -said no-one ever; Powerpoint slides just won't cut it for me, nope nope nope. Multi-modal learner here.
            </p>
                Adaptability - please be prepared to adjust your explanations if I am still not getting it. Thank you.
