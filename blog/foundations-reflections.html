        <p>
            at the end of the final sprint and I can honestly say the core stuff has proved to be extremely beneficial in managing my
            stress levels and feelings of being overwhelmed throughout the javascript challenges. I completely understand why there is such
            a big focus on mindfulness and self-care. 
        </p>
        <p>
            it's important to be reminded to be kind and patient with myself during my learning journey. Often times I'm quite hard 
            on myself if I don't grasp something as quickly as I would like but this could and usually does have a negative effect on 
            my overall progress. 
        </p>
        <p>
            the most challenging aspects of core learning was writing about, then sharing my story around culture, identity and values.
            I had decided I wasn't going to share it with the other students but at the back of my mind I knew this was not exhibiting
            the team-player attitude that I typically carry so I posted it. It was a huge step for me as I'm extremely private but I'm glad I did.
        </p>
        <p>
            the core skills module led me to the influential writings of Dale Carnegie in 'How to win friends and influence people' which talks about
            exactly what Dev Academy emphasises in that it's not so much the technical or intellectual capabilities of a person, but rather
            their attitude and ability to relate well to people that will get them farther in their career and in life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            there's a huge emphasis on the idea that it's better to hire someone who's culturally fit for the company over
            a person who has the cleanest, slickest code. I would even say this core module is much needed because let's be honest, when
            people conjure up images of a programmer, they think of a socially awkward nerd with zero ability to relate to any other human
            being NOT in the tech industry. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm glad to have spent time studying core learning and I hope that I can adopt a more natural ability to be kinder to my mind 
            and instill a growth mindset from here on out.
        </p>
