        <h3 id="main-subtitle">how my culture has shaped my values</h3>
        <p>I’ll be honest – I didn’t want to write this. I am an extremely private person, but it is some comfort knowing only one or two 
            people will read this. With that in mind to those one or two people but mainly for me, here we go…
        </p>
        <p>How my culture shaped my identity and values:
        In short – HUGELY. My parents instilled in us 4 girls (I am the youngest) a fluency in our Samoan culture. It has always been a 
        part of me ever since I remember so I sometimes go without even noticing it – like your pinky finger, you don’t even notice just 
        how useful it is until it’s injured and then you realise hey it’s not so easy peeling this apple without my pinky finger.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than my culture though my parents cemented the values by which I live to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Respect (faaaloalo): I respect all of who you are as a human being – your values, your beliefs, your perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>Loyalty (Faamaoni): the friend who will be there for you at the drop of a hat. Stuck somewhere and can’t get home? Call me. 
            Feeling down and need a non-judgmental person to listen to you? Call me. Just stuck? Call me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integrity/Honesty (Faamaoni): In all that I do; in my work and in all my relationships.

        <h3 id="main-subtitle">strengths and limitations for my learning and career development</h3>
        <p>
            I have since lost both of my parents, and almost lost my best friend to suicide this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of this, I’m constantly reminded our TIME is limited. This is a strength in my learning - I value how I spend my time
            and how I interact with others is very important to me. Each day is a chance to learn something new from people I cross paths with,
            and an opportunity to be curious; seek out those answers and not be afraid to ask.
            This will help me with my individual learning but especially with the group work.
        </p>
        <p>
            My limitations are discussed in my learning plan, but I’m easily distracted/short attention span if the content is heavy (no issues binge watching
            a series though).
            My brain processes information very slowly and often fails to store it in a safe place. When it comes time to apply it, oops can’t find it. Where’d you go? Please help me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve worked with people from different nationalities inside a metal tube at 34,000ft above sea level. Temperatures rose ALL the time and so did the stress levels. 
            Diplomacy and awareness of other cultures really played a part in ensuring a harmonious work and team environment. 
            Values kicked in BIG TIME and the sound of my mum’s voice reminding me to ‘be patient’, and ‘treat others kindly’. OK mum - but 
            what if she’s just genuinely a miserable cow? 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Be patient; treat others kindly’. Alright, got it.
