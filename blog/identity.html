        <h3 id="main-subtitle">how my culture has shaped my values</h3>
        <p>I’ll be honest – I didn’t want to write this. I am an extremely private person, but it is some comfort knowing only one or two 
            people will read this. With that in mind here we go…
        </p>
        <p>How my culture shaped my identity and values:
        In short – HUGELY. My parents instilled in us 4 girls (I am the youngest) a fluency in our Samoan culture. It has always been a 
        part of me ever since I remember - perhaps I even take this for granted sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than my culture though my parents cemented the values by which I live to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Respect (faaaloalo): I respect all of who you are as a human being – your values, your beliefs, your perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>Loyalty (Faamaoni): I'm the friend who will drop what I'm doing to be there for you. Stuck somewhere and can’t get home? Call me. 
            Feeling down and need a non-judgmental person to listen to you? Call me. Not stuck? Cool - let's chill.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integrity/Honesty (Faamaoni): In all that I do; in my work and in all my relationships.

        <h3 id="main-subtitle">strengths and limitations for my learning and career development</h3>
        <p>
            I have since lost both of my parents, and almost lost my best friend to suicide this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of this, I’m constantly reminded our TIME is limited. This is a strength in my learning - I value how I spend my time
            and how I interact with others is very important to me. Each day is a chance to learn something new from people I cross paths with,
            and an opportunity to be curious; seek out those answers and not be afraid to ask.
            This will help me with my individual learning but especially with the group work.
        </p>
        <p>
            My limitations are discussed in my learning plan, but I’m easily distracted/short attention span if the content is heavy (no issues binge watching
            a series though).
            My brain processes information very slowly and often fails to store it in a safe place. When it comes time to apply it, oops can’t find it. Where’d you go? Please help me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve worked with people from different nationalities inside a metal tube at 34,000ft above sea level. Temperatures rose ALL the time and so did the stress levels. 
            Diplomacy and awareness of other cultures really played a part in ensuring a harmonious work and team environment. 
            Values kicked in BIG TIME and the sound of my mum’s voice reminding me to ‘be patient’, and ‘treat others kindly’. OK mum - but 
            what if she’s just genuinely a miserable cow? 
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Be patient; treat others kindly’. Alright.
        </p>
