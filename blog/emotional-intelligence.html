        Emotional quotient is defined as the ability to perceive, control,

      <h3 id="main-subtitle">How is it different to IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        Intelligence quotient is a score that in short, measures your reasoning
        ability i.e. how well you can use information and logic to answer
        questions and make predictions. An IQ score of over 140 puts you in the
        'genius' category.
      </p>

      <h3 id="main-subtitle">Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        In the past it was believed the higher your IQ the better chance you
        have at a life of achievement. However this view has shifted
        dramatically and 'experts and critics' now acknowledge that success is
        not just determined by IQ but rather a combination of different factors
        - one of which is your emotional quotient.
      </p>

      <h3 id="main-subtitle">Why is it relevant to me?</h3>
      <p>
        My research on EQ kinda led me to the age-old debate of being book
        smart vs street smart. I would say most of my skills have come from life experiences - although if I put my mind to
        something, like this web development course, I know I can learn to be a programmer. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <img id="booksmart" src="../booksmart-streetsmart.jpg" /><br />
      <p>
        From the list above I can definitely relate to the left column. 
        A combination of both is required for my career development so I think upskilling in terms
        of my technical skills as well as enhancing my EQ and really idenitfying areas in which I can better incorporate that into the
        workforce are both extremely valuable tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you Dev Academy for emphasising the importance of EQ throughout
        this course.
